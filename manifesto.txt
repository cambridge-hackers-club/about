We are the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently.

We believe that places like Harvard and MIT should be incubators for world-changers, not just recruiting pools for L3 software engineers.

The future is here, and it belongs to the builders. This is the place for builders.

They can quote us, disagree with us, glorify or vilify us, but the only thing they canâ€™t do is ignore us.

We're the ones who are crazy enough to think that we can change the world.
